        Jamaican Beef Patties are delicious handheld pastries filled with savory ground beef and flavorful spices. 
        They are like little pies that you can hold in your hand and eat. 
        The pastry dough is soft and flaky, while the beef filling is seasoned with tasty spices that give it a special kick.
