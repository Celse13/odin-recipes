    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="width: 500px;">
        Black-eyed pea patties made with bacon, shallots, and roasted red peppers are pan-fried until golden brown and crispy. 
        This recipe calls for canned peas, but for more flavor, I sometimes use leftover peas that I cooked with ham hocks or smoked turkey from New Year's. 
        Get creative with how you serve them; sometimes I top them with fried green tomatoes or leftover candied yams.
